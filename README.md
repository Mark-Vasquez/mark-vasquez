# About Me

I'm a former culinary professional who accidentally grew a passion for software development. After tinkering with JavaScript tutorials online to keep myself busy on days off, I decided to take the full plunge into the world of problem solving and software engineering. The main frameworks I love working with are Flask, React, and Express.
